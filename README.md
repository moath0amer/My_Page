## Pre-commit hooks

The project includes a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) configuration to automatically check for common formatting issues. To set up the hooks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Running `pre-commit install` will configure Git so that these checks run automatically whenever you make a commit.
